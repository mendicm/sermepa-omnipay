Omnipay: RedSys (customized)
===============

**RedSys driver for the Omnipay PHP payment processing library**

[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP 5.6+. This package implements RedSys (formerly Sermepa) support for Omnipay.

Requirements
------------
- PHP >= 5.6
- Composer (`curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php`)

Installation
------------

Omnipay is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install, simply run:

```sh
composer require "mendicm/sermepa-omnipa":"dev-master"
```

Basic Usage
-----------

For general usage instructions, please see the main [Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay)
repository.

Upgrade to Omnipay 3.X
-----------

Changes for use with Omnipay 3.0

- Currency: Use the code of ISO-4217 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes) instance a number. ('EUR' => '978')


Additional Parameter
-----------

If you want to avoid having to multiply the value by 100 just add a new parameter ( multiply=true ) to the purchase function. 

Additional Callback
-----------
Redsys has an additional callback ( Respuesta online ) that may be active in your redsys platform and therfore must be implemented. This new callback cannot follow the normal usage of Omnipay. 
You need to implement checkCallbackResponse() and decodeCallbackResponse().

Customizations
--------------

Now redirect modal is rendered from blade template (Laravel) and must be stored on resources/views/omnipay/redsys.blade.php.

Form action is stored on a $url variable and hidden fields on $fields (use {!! $fields !!} to print the fields html properly)
